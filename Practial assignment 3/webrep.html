        <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JIMMY PAGE</h1>
            <P>The music that Jimmy Page made was able to transport you so that <br>
                got lost in what he was playing. His solos were show-stopping and so <br>
                innovative when it cama to guitar-playing technique at the time. He set <br>
                himself the challenge of breaking the preconceptions of what a guitar <br>
                can do, so his style evolved over time. But he was always one of the be
                greats, even when experimenting!</P>
